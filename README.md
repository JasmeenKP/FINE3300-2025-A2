Jasmeen K. P.
FINE 3300A
Assignment 2

Overview
This project analyzes Canadian Consumer Price Index (CPI) data and minimum wage trends using Python and Pandas.
It combines multiple provincial CPI datasets, calculates inflation measures, compares real versus nominal wages,
and creates both numerical summaries and visual outputs. The analysis demonstrates practical applications of
inflation and wage data interpretation within the FINE3300 course.

Files Included
- assignment2parta.py
  Contains Part A of the assignment. This script performs the CPI data import, cleaning, and inflation analysis.
  It generates Excel and image outputs summarizing average CPI changes.

- assignment2partb.ipynb
  Contains Part B of the assignment in Jupyter Notebook format.
  It extends the analysis by computing equivalent salaries, comparing nominal and real minimum wages,
  and visualizing CPI trends across provinces.

- A2 Data/
  Folder containing the CSV data files for provincial CPI information.

- CPI_Results.xlsx
  Excel output file automatically generated from the analysis.
  Includes results from the CPI and wage comparison calculations.

- CPI_Change_By_Province.png
  Visualization showing the average CPI percentage change by province.

- README.md
  Documentation describing the project purpose, structure, and instructions.


What I learned:
- Exporting and visualizing data using Pandas and Matplotlib
- Understanding and applying CPI and inflation rate formulas
- Cleaning and merging provincial CPI datasets
- Measuring average percentage changes in CPI
- Comparing nominal and real wage differences
- Evaluating service-sector CPI trends
